# Movie React Client

This repo is a React client application that interacts with the [MovieAPI](https://github.com/AkiVonAkira/MovieAPI) backend to provide users with the ability to browse and explore a collection of movies. It retrieves movie data from the MovieAPI and displays details such as movie titles, ratings, overviews, and genres. The MovieAPI backend serves as the data source for the Movie Explorer frontend, enabling seamless integration between the two repositories.

## üîë Features

- Browse and view a list of available movies Fetched from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
- See movie details including title, rating, overview, and genres.
- Filter for movies based on genres.
- User system for adding preferred genres and movie ratings.
- Error handling for handling API errors and displaying error messages.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- Styled Components: Library for styling React components using CSS-in-JS approach.
- PropTypes: Runtime type checking for React props.

## Installation

1. Follow the instructions to set up the backend [here](https://github.com/AkiVonAkira/MovieAPI).
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/AkiVonAkira/MovieReactClient.git`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd MovieReactClient`
4. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
5. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:4000` to access the React application.
2. Browse the list of available movies and filter the genres.
3. Add genres to users or ratings to movies.
4. View movies in the database.

## Shortcomings & Reflection

Most shortcomings of the application are due to the limit of my API and that the assignment did not allow us to modify or add new features.
Thus going forward I know more about what kind of endpoints and data are needed of a client, which should allow me to design better databases and API's.
